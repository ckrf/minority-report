## Murder rates
The analysis that follows is restricted to pooled 2006-2014 data in order to avoid peeking at our test set.
A histogram of murder rates shows importance of right-tail of distribution.
**The model will need to predict cities with much higher murder rates than the median.**

*Figure 1: Murder rates skew large, so the best model will predict wide variation.*

Fixed "year" effects are probably an important part of a prediction model.
The median and mean number of murders varies by about 25% peak to trough over the 10 years.
For out-of-sample predictions in new years, however, these cross-city effects would make predictive models weaker unless 
(1) national trends can be predicted, or 
(2) national trends are a function of or endogenous to local variables like economic conditions at the city level.

## Murder rates and metro characteristics

Metro areas with higher populations have more crime (in line with theory), but nevertheless does not explain significant variance and is not a sufficient predictor by itself.

Median HH income appears to be a strong predictor of murder rates, but the relationship may not be linear.
The variable's predictive power may be strongest in conjunction with other variables.

*Figure 4:  Income and poverty are also clear predictors of murder rates*

With respect to race, the proportion of African American population in a city is strongly (positively) associated with higher murder rates.

## Strength of observed relationships

For cities without missing data in the preceding predictor variables, a simple OLS model achieved an $R^2$ of 0.664, although variables like population and income do not have a statistically significant relationship with the murder rate in this model.
**In other words, the relationships described above are largely "absorbed" by demographic variables, particularly racial composition.**
When only population and poverty rate are included in an OLS prediction model, the $R^2$ falls to 0.128, suggesting the importance of interactive effects.

## Conclusion

We will try to forecast the number of murders for the subsequent year. Weâ€™ll test set R2  to assess performance. The EDA highlights the strong skew of the murder rate, which suggests different types of models would perform better in the high-crime metro areas than in low-crime metro areas. This suggests we should explore ensemble methods.
